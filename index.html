			alt="A dark black background hides its texture. Many will not see it. They will look at it and think it is solid black. But, if they lean in and look at their monitors from the side, they may catch it. The texture looks like stone. The surface fairly smooth, with a dimpled texture. Reminiscent of an orange peel. This background, a stone wall, takes up a large part of the page. Boldly standing center stage. In the left most third of this wall is the Armirage logo. It has been stylized to look like stainless steel. We hope the first thing striking about the logo is the negative space that forms a person icon. A rectangle with rounded corners with a circle above it. That shape is the hole within this stainless steel Reuleaux triangle. The sides rolled at the bottom. The artist intention to make it look leaf like. To conjure ideas earth and plants. The rolled sides with a stainless steel texture are tinted a bright green like plant leaves. The center though, where the person icon cutout resides. Has a slight swirling pattern, it is tinted a contrasting orange. It glows with a warm and inviting light. All of these pieces, the person icon, the leaf sides, the warm center, when taken as a whole form an 'A' shape. 'A' for Armirage. At the center of our company is the person. Technology should make everyone's life better. We hope the letter 'A' and the name Armirage is thought of only after seeing the person in the frame. The Open Source Software is maintained with generous support from the Community. Our work will speak for all of us." width="1280px">
